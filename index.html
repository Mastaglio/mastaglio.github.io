      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1993</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"> Welcome to our new venture, we are a small run family set-up and we are not a commercial grower; we have been growing Carnations and Pinks for many years and due to our love of these flowers and after attending many Horticultural shows around the country we realise that there is not an outlet for the general gardener to purchase Carnations, it is with this in mind that we hope to attend several Horticultural shows around the country where we will be putting on cut flower floral displays in the floral marquee and where we will also have Carnations and Pinks for sale. It is with this that we will try and answer any questions on how to grow this Aristocrat of flowers so that more gardeners can enjoy these wonderful flowers.
All plants will be from excellent stock and will be grown on by ourselves on-site with some new varieties being released at the shows, as mentioned we are not commercial growers and the plants on sale will be our surplus stock but all plants will be top class quality stock. These plants will have been grown on by ourselves for at least six months and should not be confused with rooted cuttings. They will be well rooted in pots and will be ready for potting on or placed directly in situ in the garden. <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey"></span> </p>
